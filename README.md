# pie-solo-2122

This repository contains all the software work and documentation associated with the 2021-2022 PIE on Solo quadruped platform. You can check out more on the project [here](https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative).

The goal of this project is to generate trajectories of backflips to be performed with the Solo quadruped platform. Two methods to do this are developped here:
- a classic approach with optimal control or by-hand (see OC folder)
- a reinforcement learning approach (see RL folder)
